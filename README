======================================

Pre-requisites: 
	Python-Ogre (http://www.python-ogre.org)

Setup: 
	look for plugins.cfg in either the src/ or bin/ directory
	edit plugins.cfg to point to the plugins/ folder within your Python-Ogre directory

To run: 
	execute tpclient-pyogre in the src/ folder

Description:
	Client can connect to a server, display the starmap and look around.

unless existing username and password given.

Right Click and Hold - Rotate to look around

Compiling py2exe
----------------
To compile an exe on windows, several dlls are needed

	boost_python-vc80-mt-1_35.dll - found in PythonOgre/packages_2.5/ogre/renderer/OGRE
	msvcp80.dll - found from dll-files.com
	msvcr80.dll - found from dll-files.com
	OgreMain.dll - found in PythonOgre/packages_2.5/ogre/renderer/OGRE


After the compilation step, several dlls need to be copied into the bin/ folder

	CEGUIExpatParser.dll - found in PythonOgre/packages_2.5/ogre/gui/CEGUI
	CEGUIFalagardWRBase.dll - found in PythonOgre/packages_2.5/ogre/gui/CEGUI
	CEGUITinyXMLParser.dll - found in PythonOgre/packages_2.5/ogre/gui/CEGUI

To ease this entire process, all the dlls must be copied into the dlls/ folder 
within the root directory (same level as src/, media/, etc)
